## Install pre-commit
[Official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation)

## Building artifacts

```bash
./gradlew generateAll
```

Resulting artifacts are generated in the `generated` directory at the
repository root.

## Specification structure

* For keeping consistency we have to use `components.schemas` in all files, it affects result classname in API SDK.
* File with location `openapi/v1/odmApiSdk.yaml` is autogenerated from all openapi groups in directory `openapi/v1/`, it shouldn't be manually changed.
  You can regenerate it from scratch by:
    ```shell
    ./gradlew mergeDefinitions
    ```
