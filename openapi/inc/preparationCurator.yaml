      summary: "List or search for preparation metadata objects"
      description: "Retrieve preparation metadata objects by searching/listing preparation\
        \ metadata.\n\n## Metadata full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied\
        \ as is, otherwise use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace.\
        \ Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with\
        \ a backslash (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value\
        \ pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string.\
        \ The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The\
        \ `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than\
        \ the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with\
        \ (`\"`).\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter\
        \ can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space\
        \ to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for\
        \ complex expressions.\n\n## Paging\nFor performance reasons this endpoint\
        \ returns results in \"pages\" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching\
        \ results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset\
        \ to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter.\
        \ A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page\
        \ of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result\
        \ and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset\
        \ values of `n*pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.\n\
        \n## List operation\n\nThis endpoint can be called with no `query` parameter.\
        \ Doing so returns a list of all variant objects."
