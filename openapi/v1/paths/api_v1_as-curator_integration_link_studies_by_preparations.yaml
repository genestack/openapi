    Retrieve study metadata objects whose linked preparation metadata matches
    all supplied conditions.


    ## Conditions

    It is possible to supply conditions for:


    1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)

    2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)

    3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)

    4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)

    5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data
    key-value pairs)


    ## Metadata full-text queries

    Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to
    quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters
    in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).


    ## Metadata filters

    Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator
    matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the
    literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that
    are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace
    need to be quoted with (`"`).


    ## Data queries

    Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The
    set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in
    the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace
    strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key,
    the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require
    numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with
    `|`.


    ## Combinations

    Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`,
    `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms
    and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.


    ## Versioning

    Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the
    useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are
    associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied
    to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics
    data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to
    the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the
    last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the
    query is carried out.


    Example usage:

    useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)

    useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then
    the data file is not queried)

    useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without
    CHAIN_IDs(v0) )

    useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002
    query the third version)

    useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID
    of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)


    Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ;
    separator.


    ## Paging

    For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited
    size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request
    multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this
    using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs
    the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of
    results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results
    iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the
    `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        Supply this parameter with the value `term_id` as part of the query to
        return extended information including IDs for values and dictionaries.
      in: query
      name: responseFormat
      schema:
        enum:
          - term_id

        Filter by preparation metadata (key-value metadata pair(s)). E.g.
        `Digestion=Trypsin`
      in: query
      name: filter
      schema:
        type: string
    - description: >-
        Search for preparation objects via a full-text query over all
        preparation metadata fields. E.g. `"reversed-phase liquid
        chromatography"`. Queries matching dictionary terms are automatically
        expanded to include synonyms.
      in: query
      name: query
      schema:
        type: string
    - description: >-
        If the full-text query term is present in an ODM dictionary, enabling
        this parameter will modify the query to include child terms of the
        full-text query.


        For example, the search query "Body fluid" can be expanded to include
        the term "Blood" (a child term of  "Body fluid") so files containing
        either "Body fluid" or  "Blood"  in their metadata will be returned in
        the search results.


        The parent-child relationship is defined by the key "broaders" or
        "subClassOf"  in the dictionary.


        If the full query term is not present in a dictionary then this
        parameter has no effect.
      in: query
      name: searchSpecificTerms
      schema:
        type: boolean
    - description: >-
        Maximum number of results to return. This value must be between 0 and

        Show the page {pageOffset+1} results from the start of the results. E.g.
        100 will show a page of results  starting from the 101st result. The
        default value is 0.

        The parameter defines amount of metadata attributes to return:


        1. `minimal_data` - return metadata attributes according to the default
        template.

        2. `extended_data_included` - return metadata attributes according to
        applied template, if object doesnâ€™t have applied template default
        template will be used. This is the default for User endpoints.

        3. `original_data_included` - return all metadata attributes with values
        and null attributes, if they are present in the applied template. This
        is the default for Curator endpoints.
