    ## Basic operation

    The object metadata is updated using the supplied map of attribute names to
    attribute values. There are three cases:

    1. The attribute name does not already exist in the object metadata. In this
    case, the attribute and value are added to the object metadata.

    2. The attribute name already exists in the object metadata. In this case,
    the value is updated.

    3. The attribute value is `null`.In this case, the attribute is removed from
    the object metadata.


    ## Attribute values

    The attribute values are intelligently parsed as booleans, integers, etc.
