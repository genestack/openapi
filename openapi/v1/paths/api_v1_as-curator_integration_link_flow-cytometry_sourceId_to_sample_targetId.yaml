    Create a link between a flow-cytometry object and a sample.


    A flow-cytometry object can be linked to one object only. If a
    flow-cytometry object is already linked to another object, this link will be
    deleted and a new link with the specified object will be created.

    Flow-cytometry objects of the same group can only be linked to objects of
    the same study.
