    The endpoint returns a list of active users. The list can be filtered by
    user attributes using the filter parameter. If no filtering parameters are
    passed, then all users are returned. If there are no users in the response
    body, the endpoint returns 200 OK. The "Manage organization" permission is
    required.
  operationId: findUsers
  parameters:
    - description: >-
        Filter by user attributes. The parameter name is case-sensitive,
        therefore parameters FILTER, fiLter, and other options are ignored.
         Supported operators:
         &nbsp;&nbsp;eq - equal, the attribute and operator values must be identical for a match;
         &nbsp;&nbsp;and - logical "and", the filter is only a match if both expressions evaluate to true;
         &nbsp;&nbsp;Using other operators returns an error.
         Attribute names and attribute operators used in filters are case insensitive.
         Examples of the request:
         &nbsp;&nbsp;filter=emails[type eq "work" and value eq "user@example.com"] - returns a user with login = user@example.com
         &nbsp;&nbsp;filter=userName eq "bjensen"
         &nbsp;&nbsp;filter=emails[type eq "work" and value eq "user@example.com"] and userName eq "bjensen".
