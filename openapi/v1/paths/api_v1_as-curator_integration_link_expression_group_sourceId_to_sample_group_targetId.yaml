    An expression object can be linked to one object only. If an expression
    object is already linked to another object, this link will be deleted and a
    new link with the specified object will be created.

    Expression objects of the same group can only be linked to objects of the
    same study.

     Users can specify a custom metadata field for linking omics data to samples via the “linkingAttribute” parameter, if not specified the “Sample Source ID“ sample metadata attribute will be used by default.
