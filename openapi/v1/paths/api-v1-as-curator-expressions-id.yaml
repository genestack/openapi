        Allows to get an extended or updated response body. Available values:
         `term_id` - returns extended information including IDs for values and dictionaries;
         `multi_values` - returns data with several feature attributes and several sample measurements in the response body in case the original data had them. If not specified, returns only the first feature identifier and the first measurement per sample from the original data.

        The parameter defines amount of metadata attributes to return:


        1. `minimal_data` - return metadata attributes according to the default
        template.

        2. `extended_data_included` - return metadata attributes according to
        applied template, if object doesnâ€™t have applied template, default
        template will be used. This is the default for User endpoints.

        3. `original_data_included` - return all metadata attributes with values
        and null attributes, if they are present in the applied template. This
        is the default for Curator endpoints.

    ## Basic operation

    The object metadata is updated using the supplied map of attribute names to
    attribute values. There are three cases:

    1. The attribute name does not already exist in the object metadata. In this
    case, the attribute and value are added to the object metadata.

    2. The attribute name already exists in the object metadata. In this case,
    the value is updated.

    3. The attribute value is `null`.In this case, the attribute is removed from
    the object metadata.


    ## Attribute values

    The attribute values are intelligently parsed as booleans, integers, etc.
