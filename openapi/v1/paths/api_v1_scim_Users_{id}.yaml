  summary: Retrieve a user by id
  tags:

patch:
  description: >-
    The endpoint updates one or several attributes of a specific user, where id
    is internal user id in ODM.

     Supported operators in the request body: replace, add, remove. For details of the syntax of using these operators, we recommend that you refer to the SCIM 2.0 specification.

     The list of user attributes that can be edited: userName, externalId, displayName, active. If the user tries to edit other attributes, e.g. id, an error is returned. If the user tries to edit attributes that are not supported in the ODM user scheme, e.g. name name.familyName, this attribute is ignored. If the request body includes only attributes that are not supported by ODM, the endpoint returns 200 OK.

     A PATCH request, regardless of the number of operations, is treated as atomic. If a single operation encounters an error condition, the original user attributes are restored, and a failure status is returned.

     It is possible to update attributes of the deactivated users.

     The endpoint requires the "Manage organization" permission.
