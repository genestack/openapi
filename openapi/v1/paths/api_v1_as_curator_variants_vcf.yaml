    ## Data
     This operation requires the URL of a VCF data file. Method differed from the other  SPoT POST methods as it returns additionally an id of created experiment.
     ## Metadata
     It is also possible to optionally supply the URL of a metadata file. This  metadata will be used as the original metadata for the created objects. The  file is expected to contain single record with metadata describing the uploaded signal file.
     ## Metadata file format
     * Extension: any, `.zip` and `.gz` extensions are treated as archives and get decompressed
     * Format: plain text, Tab-separated format (TSV), attribute names and record values are separated  with tabs (`U+0009`),  lines are separated with `CRLF` sequence (`U+000D U+000A`)
     * Header: the first line is treated as table header that contains attribute names
     * Records: the second line contains the values for each of the attributes described in the header line.  Values represent single string or list of strings. List values are separated  using the "pipe" `|` (`U+007C`)  separator. Values are trimmed of whitespace before parsing, and a literal `|`  (`U+007C`) character may be escaped by repeating it twice.
     ## File sources
     * Supported external sources (links): `http`/`https`/`ftp`
