    ## Versioning

    Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the
    useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are
    associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied
    to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics
    data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to
    the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the
    last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the
    query is carried out.


    Example usage:

    useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)

    useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then
    the data file is not queried)

    useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without
    CHAIN_IDs(v0) )

    useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002
    query the third version)

    useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID
    of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)


    Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ;
    separator.


    ## Paging

    For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited
    size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request
    multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this
    using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs
    the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of
    results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results
    iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the
    `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        Show the page {pageOffset+1} results from the start of the results. E.g.

        The parameter defines amount of metadata attributes to return:


        1. `minimal_data` - return metadata attributes according to the default
        template.

        2. `extended_data_included` - return metadata attributes according to
        applied template, if object doesnâ€™t have applied template default
        template will be used. This is the default for User endpoints.

        3. `original_data_included` - return all metadata attributes with values
        and null attributes, if they are present in the applied template. This
        is the default for Curator endpoints.
