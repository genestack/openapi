  description: >+
    Retrieve various types of detached data objects. An object is defined as
    'detached' if it lacks any direct or indirect link to a root-level object,
    which in this context is referred to as 'study'.

    Study is considered as detached object itself in case there are no links to
    objects at a lower level.

    Data with specific `detachedObjectType` can be retrieved by specifying the
    types in `detachedObjectType` parameter.

    The detached objects are sorted according to their `detachedObjectType` and
    `genestack:accession`.

    Specific ordering can be observed in the list of supported detached types
    found below.

    Pagination of the results can be conveniently managed using the `cursor` and
    `limit` parameters.
     Supported types of detached objects (listed in the order of retrieval) include:
     * `STUDY`
     * `SAMPLE_GROUP`
     * `LIBRARY_GROUP`
     * `PREPARATION_GROUP`
     * `TABULAR_DATA`
     * `GENE_VARIANT`
     * `FLOW_CYTOMETRY`
