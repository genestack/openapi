    ## Paging

    For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited
    size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request
    multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this
    using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs
    the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of
    results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results
    iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the
    `resultsExhausted` response field is true.
