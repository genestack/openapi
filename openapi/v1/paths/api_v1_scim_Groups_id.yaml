  summary: Retrieve a group by id
  tags:
    - Groups
patch:
  description: >-
    The endpoint updates one or several attributes of a specific group, where id
    is internal group id in ODM. Also the endpoints adds a new user to the group
    and removes users from the group.

     Supported operators in the request body: replace, add, remove. For details of the syntax of using these operators, we recommend that you refer to the SCIM 2.0 specification.

     The list of group attributes that can be edited: displayName, externalId, members. If the user tries to edit other attributes, e.g. id, an error is returned. If the user tries to edit attributes that are not supported in the ODM group scheme, this attribute is ignored. If the request body includes only attributes that are not supported by ODM, the endpoint returns 200 OK.

     A PATCH request, regardless of the number of operations, is treated as atomic. If a single operation encounters an error condition, the original user attributes are restored, and a failure status is returned.

     The endpoint requires access to the group as admin of the group: the user has the "Admin group" role in the group or the user has the "Manage groups" permission.
