        Retrieve sample metadata objects by searching/listing sample metadata.

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is, otherwise use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n*pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        ## List operation

        This endpoint can be called with no `query` parameter. Doing so returns a list of all variant objects.
      operationId: searchSamples
      parameters:
      - description: Supply this parameter with the value `term_id` as part of the

          If the full-text query term is present in an ODM dictionary, enabling this parameter will modify the query to include child terms of the full-text query.

          For example, the search query "Body fluid" can be expanded to include the term "Blood" (a child term of  "Body fluid") so files containing either "Body fluid" or  "Blood"  in their metadata will be returned in the search results.

          The parent-child relationship is defined by the key "broaders" or "subClassOf" in the dictionary.

          If the full query term is not present in a dictionary then this parameter has no effect.

          2. `extended_data_included` - return metadata attributes according to applied template, if object doesnâ€™t have applied template, default template will be used. This is the default for User endpoints.

        ## Samples metadata import
         This operation requires the URL of a samples metadata file which will be used to create sample objects.  Each record in the file should corresponds to a distinct sample.
         ## Metadata content requirements:
         1. The file should contain a column with name "Sample Source" - an id of external database,  where data came from (GEO, ArrayExpress and so on).
         2. The file should contain a column with name "Sample Source ID" - the id of that object within that database.
         3. All records should have distinct ID's (values for "Sample Source ID").
         4. At least one record should be supplied.
         ## Metadata file format
         * Extension: any, `.zip` and `.gz` extensions are treated as archives and get decompressed
         * Format: plain text, Tab-separated format (TSV), attribute names and record values are separated  with tabs (`U+0009`),  lines are separated with `CRLF` sequence (`U+000D U+000A`)
         * Header: the first line is treated as table header that contains attribute names
         * Records: the second line contains the values for each of the attributes described in the header line.  Values represent single string or list of strings. List values are separated  using the "pipe" `|` (`U+007C`)  separator. Values are trimmed of whitespace before parsing, and a literal `|`  (`U+007C`) character may be escaped by repeating it twice.

        ## Data
         This operation requires the URL of a signal data  file, for example a GCT, VCF or Flow Cytometry file. The required form of this file depends  on the specific SPoT.

         ## Metadata
         It is also possible to optionally supply the URL of a metadata file. This  metadata will be used as the original metadata for the created objects. The  file is expected to contain single record with metadata describing the uploaded signal file.
         ## Metadata file format
         * Extension: any, `.zip` and `.gz` extensions are treated as archives and get decompressed

        The object metadata is updated using the supplied map of attribute names to attribute values. There are three cases:
        1. The attribute name does not already exist in the object metadata. In this case, the attribute and value are added to the object metadata.
        2. The attribute name already exists in the object metadata. In this case, the value is updated.
        3. The attribute value is `null`.In this case, the attribute is removed from the object metadata.

        ## Attribute values
        The attribute values are intelligently parsed as booleans, integers, etc.
