  numberOfFeatureAttributes:
    description: >-
      Integer value that specifies the number of columns related to the feature
      in the uploaded data frame, and indicates the starting position of the
      sample data. This attribute is not needed if the uploaded file is in GCT
      format.
    example: 5
    type: integer
  dataClass:
    description: >-
      A mandatory parameter with the following possible values: `Bulk
      transcriptomics`, `Single-cell transcriptomics`, `Differential abundance
      (FC, pval, etc.)`, `Pathway analysis`, `Proteomics`, `Single-cell
      proteomics`, `Metabolomics`, `Epigenomics`, `DNA methylation`,
      `Chemoinformatics`, `Imaging features`, `Gene panel data`, `Biomarker
      data`, `Physical measures`, `Blood counts`, `Other body fluid counts`,
      `Nanopore`, `Other`. 

      In case the parameter is not set the dataClass is automatically defined as
      `Other`.
    example: Proteomics
    type: string
  measurementSeparator:
    description: >-
      This parameter is necessary when your file contains multiple measurement
      columns for each sample, library, or preparation. It represents the
      character that distinguishes the sample/library/preparation name from the
      measurement name in column headers. Supported separators include `. , : ;
      _ - / \ |`, with the allowance for multi-character separators.
    example: ':'
    type: string
