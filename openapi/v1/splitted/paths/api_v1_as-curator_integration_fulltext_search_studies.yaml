    Find studies and retrieve their data by searching via a full-text or facets
    search of study or linked objects metadata (e.g. samples, libraries,
    preparations, omics metadata).  Only studies available to a user are
    returned.

     The endpoint returns:
     - a list of studies with their metadata summary
     - a list of facet objects with counts; the facet list can be configured in the "Study Browser" application using the "Configure facets" option (by a user with appropriate permissions). For each facet object only the first 5 most popular values are returned, these are sorted by the number of matching studies in descending order.  Only studies available to the user are counted.
