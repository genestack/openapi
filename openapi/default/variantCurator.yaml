      summary: "Retrieve multiple variant data and metadata objects"
      description: "Retrieve all variant data and metadata objects that match a query.\n\
        \n## Metadata full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied as is, otherwise\
        \ use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech\
        \ marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash\
        \ (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value pairs joined\
        \ by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=`\
        \ operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>`\
        \ operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied\
        \ value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).\n\n\
        ## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined\
        \ with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate\
        \ out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.\n\
        \n## Versioning\nSpecific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried\
        \ via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file\
        \ are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied\
        \ to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics\
        \ data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied\
        \ to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually\
        \ the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest\
        \ of the query is carried out.\n\nExample usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all\
        \ versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)\nuseVersions=v2 (query the\
        \ second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not\
        \ queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files\
        \ without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )\nuseVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with\
        \ a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)\nuseVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496\
        \ (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific\
        \ accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\nRules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be\
        \ supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor\
        \ performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of\
        \ limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page\
        \ of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from\
        \ your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more\
        \ results you will just retrieve an empty result.\n\n"
