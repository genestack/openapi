      summary: "Retrieve multiple flow cytometry data and metadata objects"
      description: "Retrieve all flow cytometry data and metadata objects that match\
        \ a query.\n\n## Metadata full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied\
        \ as is, otherwise use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace.\
        \ Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with\
        \ a backslash (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value\
        \ pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string.\
        \ The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The\
        \ `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than\
        \ the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with\
        \ (`\"`).\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter\
        \ can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space\
        \ to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for\
        \ complex expressions.\n\n## Versioning\nSpecific versions of omics data files\
        \ (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions\
        \ of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value.\
        \ This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the\
        \ version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in\
        \ the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only\
        \ the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried.\
        \ This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.\n\nExample\
        \ usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)\n\
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then\
        \ the data file is not queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version\
        \ and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )\nuseVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for\
        \ omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)\nuseVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496\
        \ (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific\
        \ accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\nRules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be\
        \ supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor\
        \ performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of\
        \ limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page\
        \ of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from\
        \ your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more\
        \ results you will just retrieve an empty result.\n\n"

        \ starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset\
        \ query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return\
        \ the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from\
        \ the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages\
        \ using pageOffset values of `n*pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response\
        \ field is true.\n\n## List operation\n\nThis endpoint can be called with\
        \ no `query` parameter. Doing so returns a list of all data objects."
