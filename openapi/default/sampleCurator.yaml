      summary: "List or search for sample metadata objects"
      description: "Retrieve sample metadata objects by searching/listing sample metadata.\n\
        \n## Metadata full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied as is, otherwise\
        \ use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech\
        \ marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash\
        \ (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value pairs joined\
        \ by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=`\
        \ operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>`\
        \ operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied\
        \ value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).\n\n\
        ## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined\
        \ with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate\
        \ out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.\n\
        \n## Paging\nFor performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\"\
        \ of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs\
        \ to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You\
        \ can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default)\
        \ instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return\
        \ a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all\
        \ results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n*pageLimit` until\
        \ the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.\n\n## List operation\n\n\
        This endpoint can be called with no `query` parameter. Doing so returns a\
        \ list of all variant objects."
