    This swagger page describes the integrationUser APIs for ODM. These are typically used to find and retrieve study, sample and processed (signal) data and metadata for a given query.

    Before carrying out any API calls you will need an API token. API tokens can be obtained under your profile within the Genestack software. Further instructions can be found [here](https://odm-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc-odm-user-guide/getting-a-genestack-api-token.html).

    To try out calls in this swagger page:

    1.  Click the 'Authorize' button below to enter your API token
    2.  Scroll to the 'Parameters' section for the method you wish to try out and click the 'Try it out' button
    3.  Enter parameter values that you wish to try
    4.  Scroll to the bottom of the Parameters section and click the 'Execute' bar that appears


     The server response will be in the section that follows.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        Retrieve library metadata objects whose linked sample metadata matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter.

          The parent-child relationship is defined by the key "broaders" or "subClassOf"  in the dictionary.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        Retrieve preparation metadata objects whose linked sample metadata matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter.

        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

    get:
      description: |+
        Retrieve study metadata objects whose linked sample metadata matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.

        \ The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented\
        \ in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace\
        \ strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`\"`). Depending on the key,\

        \ numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values\
        \ with `|`.\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter\
        \ can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space\
        \ to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for\

    get:
      description: |+
        Retrieve group objects whose linked data matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty result.

          If the full-text query term is present in an ODM dictionary, enabling this parameter will modify the query to include child terms of the full-text query.

          For example, the search query "Body fluid" can be expanded to include the term "Blood" (a child term of  "Body fluid") so files containing either "Body fluid" or  "Blood"  in their metadata will be returned in the search results.

          The parent-child relationship is defined by the key "broaders" or "subClassOf"  in the dictionary.

        Retrieve flow cytometry data objects whose linked data matches all supplied conditions.

        Note: A flow cytometry data query must be supplied.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty result.

      description: |+
        Retrieve group objects whose linked data matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty result.

          If the full-text query term is present in an ODM dictionary, enabling this parameter will modify the query to include child terms of the full-text query.

          For example, the search query "Body fluid" can be expanded to include the term "Blood" (a child term of  "Body fluid") so files containing either "Body fluid" or  "Blood"  in their metadata will be returned in the search results.

          The parent-child relationship is defined by the key "broaders" or "subClassOf"  in the dictionary.

        Retrieve sample metadata objects whose linked data matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty result.

          If the full-text query term is present in an ODM dictionary, enabling this parameter will modify the query to include child terms of the full-text query.

          For example, the search query "Body fluid" can be expanded to include the term "Blood" (a child term of  "Body fluid") so files containing either "Body fluid" or  "Blood"  in their metadata will be returned in the search results.

          The parent-child relationship is defined by the key "broaders" or "subClassOf"  in the dictionary.

          If the full query term is not present in a dictionary then this parameter has no effect.

          \ value>=1.50`\n For the case when the original data is represented by multiple\
          \ attributes per feature scenarios, extended filtering syntax is as follows:\
          \ \n1. By feature attribute value for numeric and string attributes: `feature.NAME=1007_s_at`\
          \ or `feature.\"Average Mz\"=2.218`. As in the case of sample metadata queries,\
          \ single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`\"`)\

          \ a set of possible values, separated by comma: `feature.NAME=1007_s_at,121_at`.\
          \ \n3. Utilize range filters to search numeric attributes. Apply `<` (less\
          \ than), `>` (greater than), and `=` (equal to) symbols to specify the desired\
          \ ranges as follows: \n`feature.Name_1 > 3`: Select all rows where the feature\
          \ attribute Name_1 values are greater than 3. \n`feature.Name_2 >= 6`: Select\
          \ all rows where the feature attribute Name_2 values are greater than or\
          \ equal to 6. \n`-3 < feature.Name_3 < 3`: Select all rows where the feature\
          \ attribute Name_3 values lie within the interval between -3 and 3. \n4.\
          \ Use substring search to get the records where the attribute field contains\
          \ the provided substring: `feature.attribute1 =~ \"some text\"`. \n5. The\
          \ first column for each original data file is identified as feature accession\
          \ (typically, it contains gene or protein names, accession IDs, etc.). Searching\
          \ by such feature accession would significantly outperform more complex\
          \ queries by combining the other feature attributes. To enable such a search,\
          \ use `feature` without any attribute extension, e.g., `feature=ENSG00000230368,ENSG00000188976`.\n\
          \ \nThe `value` keyword can be used to select rows where the sample (library\
          \ or preparation) measurements has values from a certain range. Examples:\
          \ `value = 3`, `value > 3`, `-3 < value < 3`. When the original data contains\
          \ multiple measurements for a single item, such as a sample (library or\
          \ preparation), use the measurement name to specify the exact column type,\
          \ e.g.: \n1. `value.intensity = 3`: Selects all rows where the measurement\
          \ attribute intensity equals 3. \n `value.intensity != 2,null`: Select all\
          \ rows where the measurement attribute intensity is not equal 2 and is not\
          \ an empty value. \n`value.p_value > 3`: Selects all rows where the measurement\
          \ attribute 'p_value' values are greater than 3. \n`-3 < value.FC < 3`:\
          \ Selects all rows where the measurement attribute 'FC' values lie within\
          \ the interval between -3 and 3.\n \n2. Note: The `MinValue` keyword has\
          \ been deprecated and should be replaced with the aforementioned comparisons.\n\
          \ \nCombine multiple filters for different feature attributes and measurements\
          \ using `AND` (`&&`), `OR` (`||`) logical operators and parentheses: \n\
          * `feature.Name_1!=A`: Select all rows where Name_1 is not A. \n* `feature.Name_1!=A,B,C`:\
          \ Select all rows where Name_1 is not A, B, or C. \n* `feature.Name_1=A\

          \ B. \n* `feature.Name_1=A && feature.Name_2=B`: Equivalent to the example\
          \ above. \n* `feature.Name_1=A OR feature.Name_2=B`: Select all rows where\
          \ Name_1 is A or Name_2 is B. \n* `feature.Name_1=A || feature.Name_2=B`:\

    get:
      description: |+
        Retrieve group objects whose linked data matches all supplied conditions.

        ## Conditions
        It is possible to supply conditions for:

        1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)
        3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        4. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)
        5. Linked any data (except variant and flow cytometry) objects (list of data key-value pairs)

        ## Metadata full-text queries
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

        ## Metadata filters
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`"`).

        ## Data queries
        Data queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.

        ## Combinations
        Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.

        ## Versioning
        Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.

        Example usage:
        useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried)
        useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )
        useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)

        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.

        ## Paging
        For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in "pages" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty result.
