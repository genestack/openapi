    \ data and metadata for a given query.\n\nBefore carrying out any API calls you\
    \ will need an API token. API tokens can be obtained under your profile within\
    \ the Genestack software. Further instructions can be found [here](https://odm-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc-odm-user-guide/getting-a-genestack-api-token.html).\n\
    \nTo try out calls in this swagger page:\n\n1.  Click the 'Authorize' button below\
    \ to enter your API token\n2.  Scroll to the 'Parameters' section for the method\
    \ you wish to try out and click the 'Try it out' button\n3.  Enter parameter values\
    \ that you wish to try\n4.  Scroll to the bottom of the Parameters section and\

      description: "Retrieve library metadata objects whose linked sample metadata\
        \ matches all supplied conditions.\n\n## Conditions\nIt is possible to supply\
        \ conditions for:\n\n1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)\n2.\
        \ Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value pair)\n3. Linked variant\
        \ objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n4. Linked expression objects (list\
        \ of data key-value pairs)\n5. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data\
        \ key-value pairs)\n\n## Metadata full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied\
        \ as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace.\
        \ Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with\
        \ a backslash (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value\
        \ pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string.\
        \ The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The\
        \ `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than\
        \ the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with\
        \ (`\"`).\n\n## Data queries\nData queries must be a list of key-value pairs,\
        \ separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query\
        \ type, and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be\
        \ simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`\"\
        `). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string\
        \ values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)`\
        \ syntax, OR values with `|`.\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters\
        \ for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators,\
        \ using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `(\
        \ )` can be used for complex expressions.\n\n## Versioning\nSpecific versions\
        \ of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter.\

        \ metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter\

        \ metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter\

        \ then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is\
        \ queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.\n\
        \nExample usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all versions, including those without\
        \ CHAIN_IDs)\nuseVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second\
        \ version then the data file is not queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the\

        \ of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\n\
        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ;\
        \ separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor performance reasons this endpoint returns results\
        \ in \"pages\" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results\
        \ the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the\
        \ first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value\
        \ of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results,\
        \ 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so\
        \ on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values\
        \ of `n * pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.\n\

      description: "Retrieve expression data objects whose linked data matches all\
        \ supplied conditions.\n\nNote: An expression data query must be supplied.\n\
        \n## Conditions\nIt is possible to supply conditions for:\n\n1. Samples (full-text\
        \ or metadata key-value pair)\n2. Parent studies (full-text or metadata key-value\
        \ pair)\n3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n4. Linked\
        \ expression objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n5. Linked flow cytometry\
        \ objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n\n## Metadata full-text queries\n\
        Single words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`\"`) to quote\
        \ queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in\
        \ the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\n\
        Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator\
        \ matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except\
        \ the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results\
        \ that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace\
        \ need to be quoted with (`\"`).\n\n## Data queries\nData queries must be\
        \ a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace. The set of valid keys\
        \ depends on the specific query type, and is documented in the query parameter\
        \ summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed\
        \ by speech marks (`\"`). Depending on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited\
        \ list of string values. Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied\
        \ with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values with `|`.\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters\
        \ for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators,\
        \ using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `(\
        \ )` can be used for complex expressions.\n\n## Versioning\nSpecific versions\
        \ of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter.\
        \ Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID\
        \ metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter\
        \ along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to\
        \ include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter\
        \ then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is\
        \ queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.\n\
        \nExample usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all versions, including those without\
        \ CHAIN_IDs)\nuseVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second\
        \ version then the data file is not queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the\
        \ first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )\nuseVersions=GSVC002:v3\
        \ (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)\n\
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID\
        \ of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\n\
        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ;\
        \ separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor performance reasons this endpoint returns results\
        \ in \"pages\" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the\
        \ next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query\
        \ from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results\
        \ you will just retrieve an empty result.\n\n"

          For the case when the original data is represented by multiple attributes per feature (e.g., multi_values) \
          scenarios, extended filtering syntax is as follows: \
          \n1. By feature attribute value for numeric and string attributes: `features.NAME=1007_s_at` or \
          `features.\"Average Mz\"=2.218`. As in the case of sample metadata queries, single words can be supplied \
          as is; otherwise, use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace.
          \n2. It is possible to specify a set of possible values, separated by comma: `features.NAME=1007_s_at,121_at`.
          \n3. Use a combination of several conditions to search by more than one feature attribute at once: \
          `features.NAME=1007_s_at features.Description=\"probe set\"`.
          \n4. The first column for each original data file is identified as feature accession \
          (typically, it contains gene or protein names, accession IDs, etc.). Searching by such feature accession \
          would significantly outperform more complex queries by combining the other feature attributes. \
          To enable such a search, use `feature` without any attribute extension, e.g., \

      summary: "Retrieve group objects by searching across multiple data types"
      description: "Retrieve group objects whose linked data matches all supplied\
        \ conditions.\n\n## Conditions\nIt is possible to supply conditions for:\n\
        \n1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)\n2. Parent studies (full-text\
        \ or metadata key-value pair)\n3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value\
        \ pairs)\n4. Linked expression objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n5.\
        \ Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n\n## Metadata\
        \ full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech\
        \ marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and\
        \ backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\\
        `).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value pairs joined by\
        \ an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator\
        \ matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators\
        \ match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value.\
        \ Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).\n\n## Data\
        \ queries\nData queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace.\
        \ The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented\
        \ in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace\
        \ strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`\"`). Depending on the key,\
        \ the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require\
        \ numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values\
        \ with `|`.\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter\
        \ can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space\
        \ to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for\
        \ complex expressions.\n\n## Versioning\nSpecific versions of omics data files\
        \ (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions\
        \ of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value.\
        \ This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the\
        \ version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in\
        \ the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only\
        \ the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried.\
        \ This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.\n\nExample\
        \ usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)\n\
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then\
        \ the data file is not queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version\
        \ and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )\nuseVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for\
        \ omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)\nuseVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496\
        \ (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific\
        \ accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\nRules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be\
        \ supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor performance\
        \ reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size together\
        \ with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply\
        \ this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get\
        \ the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty\
        \ result.\n\n"

      summary: "Retrieve sample metadata objects by searching across multiple data\
        \ types"
      description: "Retrieve sample metadata objects whose linked data matches all\
        \ supplied conditions.\n\n## Conditions\nIt is possible to supply conditions\
        \ for:\n\n1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)\n2. Parent studies\
        \ (full-text or metadata key-value pair)\n3. Linked variant objects (list\
        \ of data key-value pairs)\n4. Linked expression objects (list of data key-value\
        \ pairs)\n5. Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n\
        \n## Metadata full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied as is; otherwise,\
        \ use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech\
        \ marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash\
        \ (`\\`).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value pairs joined\
        \ by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=`\
        \ operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>`\
        \ operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied\
        \ value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).\n\n\
        ## Data queries\nData queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated\
        \ by whitespace. The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type,\
        \ and is documented in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple\
        \ non-whitespace strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`\"`). Depending\
        \ on the key, the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values.\
        \ Others require numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax,\
        \ OR values with `|`.\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the\
        \ same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators,\
        \ using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `(\
        \ )` can be used for complex expressions.\n\n## Versioning\nSpecific versions\
        \ of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter.\
        \ Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID\
        \ metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter\
        \ along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to\
        \ include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter\
        \ then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is\
        \ queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.\n\
        \nExample usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all versions, including those without\
        \ CHAIN_IDs)\nuseVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second\
        \ version then the data file is not queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the\
        \ first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )\nuseVersions=GSVC002:v3\
        \ (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)\n\
        useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID\
        \ of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\n\
        Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ;\
        \ separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor performance reasons this endpoint returns results\
        \ in \"pages\" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the\
        \ next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query\
        \ from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results\
        \ you will just retrieve an empty result.\n\n"

      summary: "Retrieve group objects by searching across multiple data types"
      description: "Retrieve group objects whose linked data matches all supplied\
        \ conditions.\n\n## Conditions\nIt is possible to supply conditions for:\n\
        \n1. Samples (full-text or metadata key-value pair)\n2. Parent studies (full-text\
        \ or metadata key-value pair)\n3. Linked variant objects (list of data key-value\
        \ pairs)\n4. Linked expression objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n5.\
        \ Linked flow cytometry objects (list of data key-value pairs)\n\n## Metadata\
        \ full-text queries\nSingle words can be supplied as is; otherwise, use speech\
        \ marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and\
        \ backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\\
        `).\n\n## Metadata filters\nMetadata filters are key-value pairs joined by\
        \ an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator\
        \ matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators\
        \ match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value.\
        \ Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).\n\n## Data\
        \ queries\nData queries must be a list of key-value pairs, separated by whitespace.\
        \ The set of valid keys depends on the specific query type, and is documented\
        \ in the query parameter summary. The values can be simple non-whitespace\
        \ strings, or strings enclosed by speech marks (`\"`). Depending on the key,\
        \ the value may be be a comma-delimited list of string values. Others require\
        \ numerical values. Ranges can be supplied with `(0:1)` syntax, OR values\
        \ with `|`.\n\n## Combinations\nMetadata queries/filters for the same parameter\
        \ can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space\
        \ to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for\
        \ complex expressions.\n\n## Versioning\nSpecific versions of omics data files\
        \ (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions\
        \ of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value.\
        \ This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the\
        \ version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in\
        \ the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only\
        \ the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried.\
        \ This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.\n\nExample\
        \ usage:\nuseVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs)\n\
        useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then\
        \ the data file is not queried)\nuseVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version\
        \ and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) )\nuseVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for\
        \ omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version)\nuseVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496\
        \ (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific\
        \ accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)\n\nRules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be\
        \ supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.\n\n## Paging\nFor performance\
        \ reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size together\
        \ with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply\
        \ this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get\
        \ the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty\
        \ result.\n\n"
