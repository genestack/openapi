  description: "#### NOTE: these API endpoints are experimental. The parameters, request\
    \ body and response body may change.\n\nThese API endpoints serve to start, control,\
    \ monitor and retrieve results for a set of available Genestack jobs.\n\nA job\
    \ is an arbitrary process that, once started, runs asynchronously in the background.\n\
    Upon starting a job the user receives a job execution identifier (`jobExecId`)\
    \ that they can use to control and monitor the job and to retrieve the job result\
    \ (output).\n\n#### Basic workflow:\n\nStart a job (POST endpoints) to return\
    \ a `jobExecId`\nPeriodically poll the `GET /{jobExecId}/output` endpoint to get\
    \ the job status for a given `jobExecId`\nWhen the status is `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`,\
    \ queries to the `GET /{jobExecId}/output` endpoint will also contain any output\
    \ (result/errors)\n\nTo retrieve more information about a job, such as start time\
    \ etc., use the `GET /{jobExecId}/info` endpoint.\n\n#### Available statuses:\n\
    \n- `STARTING`: initial job status\n- `RUNNING`: the job has successfully started\
    \ and is running\n- `COMPLETED` (terminal): the job has completed and the result\
    \ is available in the `GET /{jobExecId}/output` response\n- `FAILED` (terminal):\
    \ the job has failed, you can extract errors from the `GET /{jobExecId}/output`\
    \ response\n- `STOPPING`: a stop request has been initiated, the job is in the\
    \ process of stopping\n- `STOPPED` (terminal): the job has been stopped (it may\
    \ be able to be restarted)\n- `ABANDONED` (terminal): the job has been abandoned\
    \ for an unknown reason, please contact your system administrator.\n- `UNKNOWN`:\
    \ the job status is unknown, please contact your system administrator.\n"
